# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a PRD (Product Requirements Document) reference repository containing templates and best practices for writing product requirements documents.

## Key Files

- `prd_template.md` - A comprehensive PRD template with sections for context/strategy, audience, solution, release logistics, and risk management
- `excellent_prd.md` - Guidelines on what makes an excellent PRD, including structure recommendations and common pitfalls

## PRD Structure Convention

PRDs in this repository follow a "Zoom In" structure:
1. **Context & Strategy (The "Why")** - Problem statement, goals, success metrics
2. **The Audience (The "Who")** - Target personas and user stories
3. **The Solution (The "What")** - Functional requirements, UX/design, technical requirements
4. **Release & Logistics (The "How")** - Scope, phasing, dependencies

## Prioritization System

Requirements use the P-system:
- **P0** = Critical/Must Have
- **P1** = Important/Should Have
- **P2** = Nice to Have
